		<h1>Bisexuali-Tea Party 2025</h1>
		<p>Scones? Crumpets? Which one? Why not both? Bi+ Pride Milwaukee requests the pleasure of your company at our annual tea celebrating BiVisibility Month! </p>
		<p>Please join us on September 20, 2025, at 2 PM at the <a href="https://www.mkelgbt.org/" target="_blank">Milwaukee LGBT Community Center</a> to share Bi+ joy, some treats, and a cup of tea. We will have several teas brewing and a variety of sweet and savory treats to feast on. If you would like, you are welcome to bring a specialty of yours to share with our community, but it is in no way a requirement. Showing up as your authentic self is enough.</p>
		<p>Feel free to wear what makes you feel most comfortable and most bi+! Dress up or down as you like! Bonus points for a fancy hat!</p>
