		<p>Bi+ Pride Milwaukee is a bisexual+ social, support, and advocacy group. Since 2014, we have been building a strong, vibrant bisexual/pansexual/no-label/fluid/queer/non-monosexual community in Milwaukee and Southeastern Wisconsin. In 2019, Milwaukee Pride honored us with a Pride Award for our contributions to the community.</p>

				<h2>Events</h2>
				<p><strong>Mission:</strong> To create a sustainable social community for non-monosexual individuals (and their partners and allies) in the Milwaukee metropolitan area.</p>
				<p>Every June, we march in the Milwaukee Pride Parade and provide education about our community at Pridefest. Every September, we promote bisexual+ awareness by working with our city and state governments to get proclamations signed and bi flags hoisted, as well as host our biggest event of the year, the Bisexualitea Party. The rest of the year, join us at discussion groups, book clubs, casual cafe chats, movie nights, and more. We'd love to see you there!</p>
