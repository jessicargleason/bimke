Join Bi+ Pride Milwaukee for a book discussion at the LGBT Community Center. August's book is a historical romance focused on a widowed Bisexual Highwayman (and Coffee House Owner) Kitt Webb, and a nobleman named Percy (who happens to be the son of the very Duke who mysteriously wronged Kitt Webb in the past).

Although this title is her first novel released as a trade paperback, Cat Sebastian has long been recognized for her queer historical romances.
