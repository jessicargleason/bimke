From Emily Rath, best known for her spicy polyamorous hockey romances (one of which we’ll read as a bonus book this coming year!) this mythical, fantastical epic follows two women in twelfth century Finland who defy the living and the dead of Finnish Folklore in order to save their village and their culture from Swedish Christian invaders, even if it takes them to the underworld. First in a duology.
