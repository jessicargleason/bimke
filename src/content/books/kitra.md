In the first book in the delightful YA Kitra saga, we follow Kitra and her crew of friends as they salvage a Navy spaceship and prepare to live their dreams of spaceflight…only to be unexpectedly plunged into hyperspace and stranded lightyears away from their planet.
Tensions rise between Kitra and her shipmates: the handsome programmer, Fareedh; Marta, biologist and Kitra's ex-girlfriend; Peter, the panicking engineer, and the oddball alien navigator, Pinky. Now, running low on air and food, it'll take all of them working together to get back home.

(Note: there are illustrations in this short novel, and the illustrator is the youngest Hugo Nominee in history!)
