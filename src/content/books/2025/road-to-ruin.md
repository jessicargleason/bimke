August's book is a fantasy novel with some Mad max vibes, following a magebike courier, Jin-Lu, as she brings secret messages back and forth across the desert wastes on an enchanted motorbike wearing a helmet made of ...basically dinosaur bone. She's been smuggling love letters between a prince and a princess from different domed cities in the climate-ravaged wastes... and has maybe fallen a little bit in love with each of them in the process.

Which is why she agrees to help the Princess with a daring, desperate, last-minute escape even though a deadly storm is brewing in the wastes, and there's no guarantee they'll make it through alive.
