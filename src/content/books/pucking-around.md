This one is for our fans of spicy contemporary romance!

Rachel Price is getting her life on track and trying to stay out of her famous family’s shadow to make it on her own in sports medicine. She’s gotten a last-minute chance at her dream job working for a pro hockey team, and she’s not about to be distracted by the hot equipment manager, or the gorgeous goalie who thinks she’s his good luck charm. She already met and lost her Mr. Perfect a few months ago during a magical one night stand on the other side of the country, and she's here to focus.

One slight problem: Mr. Perfect Mistake turns out to be the hot equipment manager’s bestie. And also one of the players on this NHL team.
