Join Bi+ Pride Milwaukee for a book discussion at the LGBT Community Center. April's book is "Baggage: Tales From a Fully Packed Life". This memoir from openly bisexual stage and screen actor Alan Cumming, who was once touted by the New York Observer as a "frolicky pansexual sex symbol for the new millennium" tells his story in this collection of anecdotes, recollections and musings where every chapter title ends in the letter "y".
