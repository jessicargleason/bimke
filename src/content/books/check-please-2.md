Bonus Book Club! Check, Please Vol II by Ngozi Ukazu
Join Bi+ Pride Milwaukee for a BONUS book discussion at the LGBT Community Center!
We read book 1 of Bitty’s college adventures a year ago, and we’re returning to Samwell University and the Hockey team there as Bitty and his boyfriend figure out if they want their relationship to be public knowledge. (and yes, there’s still baking, it’s Bitty after all!)
