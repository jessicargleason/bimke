February's book is a sweet-as-pie graphic novel that follows figure-skater and vlogger (and baker!) Eric "Bitty" Bittle as he heads to Samwell University... and gets recruited for the Hockey team!

Bitty finds his footing, bakes his feelings, makes friends with an unforgettable cast of characters, develops a crush on a teammate, and finds the courage to come out as gay.

(And if anyone wonders why we're over here reading a book with a Gay MC for Bi+ Book Club? Shhhh, spoilers!)
