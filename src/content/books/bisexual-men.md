June's book is a non-fiction offering from author Vaneet Mehta, creator of the #bisexualmenexist campaign, and was recommended as a book club read by a member of Bi+ Pride Milwaukee!

From the Publisher's description: "Navigating a range of topics, including coming out, dating, relationships and health, Vaneet shares his own lived experience as well as personal stories from others in the community to help validate and uplift other bisexual men. Discussing the treatment of m-spec men in LGBTQ+ places, breaking down stereotypes and highlighting the importance of representation and education, this empowering book is a rallying call for m-spec men everywhere."
