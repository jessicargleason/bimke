April's book is a myth-inflected story of revolution and magic in a queer-normative society set against the glittering, semi-submerged city of Tiankawi, a city where humans living in skyscrapers literally look down upon the "fathomfolk" — sirens, seawitches, water-dragons, kelpies and kappas—who live in the polluted waters below. Centering East-Asian mythology and engaging with topics like marginalization and alienation, this novel is written by a Scottish-born Chinese-diaspora author.

In her own words, a fast-pitch description of the book: "what if the little mermaid was an angry immigrant in a semi-flooded East and Southeast Asian inspired city, and it was never for the love of a man—it was for the love of her home."
